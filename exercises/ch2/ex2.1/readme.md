# Excercise 2.1

## Task

Add types, constants and functions to tempconv for processing temperatures
in Kelvin scale, where zero Kelvin is -273.15 °C and a difference of 1K
has same magnitude as 1°C.

## Implementation

Adding additional functions and constants to tempconv. The main function
is using some new function to demonstrate the usage.

## Test

go run main.go 100
