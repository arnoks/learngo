7.8 Many Guis provide a table widget with a stateful multi-tier sort: the
    primary sort key is most recently clicked column head, the secondary sort
    key is the second-most recently clicked column head, and so on. Define an
    implementation of sort.Interface for use by such a table. Compare that 
    approach with repeated sorting using sort.Stable

7.1 ch7/bytecounter
    Using the ideas from ByteCounter, implement counters for words and
    for lines. You will find bufio.Scanwords useful.

7.2 Write a function CountingWriter with the signature below that, given
    an io.Writer, returns a new Writer that wraps the original, and a 
    pointer to an int64 variable that at any moment contains the 
    number of bytes written to the new Writer. 
    func CountingWriter(w io.Writer)(io.Writer, *int64)

7.3 ch4/tresort/main.go 
    Write a String Method for the *tree type in ch4/treesort that reveals
    the sequence of values in the tree.

7.4 The strings.NewReader function returns a avalue that satisfies the io.Reader
    interface (and others) by reading from its argument, a string. Implement a 
    simple version of NewReader yourself, and use it to make the HTML parser 
    (5.2) take input from a string

7.5 The LimitReader function in the io package accepts an io.Reader r and a
    number of bytes n, and returns another Reader that reads from r but reports
    and end-of-file condition after n bytes. Implement it. 

7.6 Added support for Kelvin temperatures to tempflag in ch 7

7.7 Explain why the help messages contains Â°C when the default value of 20.0 
    does not.
    The default is just a float while the help message prints the string!
