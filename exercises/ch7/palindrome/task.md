# 7.10 Palindrome

The sort interface type can be adapted to other uses. Write a
function isPalindrom (s sort.Interface) bool that reports
whetherthe sequence is a     palindrome, in other words,
reversing the sequnce would notchnage it.     Assume that the
elements at indices i, j are equal if!s.Less(i,j) && !s.Less
(j,i)
