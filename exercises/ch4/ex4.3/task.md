# Excercise 4.3

## Description

Rewrite reverse to use an array pointer instead of a slice

## Implementation

Array pointers are unflexible. In case of using an array pointer the size 
needs to match. I have no idea how to avid this. Similar as the sha256 implementation
you need to use slices in order to become flexible. This is a go feature and
not a bug.
